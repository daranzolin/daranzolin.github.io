# What is Historical Materialism?
--

> *"The Marxist theory of history that insists that history proceeds inevitably on a path from feudalism to communism owing to the development of the forces of production."*

.pull-right[
&#150; Tim Creswell in *Geographic Thought: A Critical Introduction*

<br>

> _"...a **methodology** used by **scientific socialists** to understand human societies and their development through history, arguing that historical changes in social structure are the result of material and technological conditions **rather than ideals.**"_

.panel[.panel-name[Dialectics]

The interaction between **contradictory forces** produces something new (e.g. thesis-antithesis-synthesis).

![:col_list Socratic dialogues, Systematized idealism, "Turned Hegel on his head"]
<br>
![:col_list Exchange of ideas, "World Spirit" moves history, Material forces move history]

]
.panel[.panel-name[Idealism]

The emphasis on **ideas** as historical movers and shakers. For Historical Materialists, idealism obscures reality and is generally an error to be avoided.

For example, consider the American Revolution: was it motivated by sentiments of liberty, fraternity, and equality (idealism), or rather, an emerging young merchant class increasingly coming into conflict with the vestiges of feudal society (materialism)?  

Which explanation has more *explanatory power?* 
<br>
Which explanation *demystifies reality* in a more coherent fashion?
