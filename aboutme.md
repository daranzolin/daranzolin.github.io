I studied English literature and religious studies, finishing my M.T.S from Emory University in 2013. After school I soon learned that writing code was more fun than writing papers.

For data analysis and visualization, I use SQL, R, D3.js, and a little HTML/CSS. Software developed and maintained on GitHub. Other tools and applications: ESRI ArcMap, Observable, IBM Cognos Analytics.

I love to hoop, golf, game, code, try to understand Kierkegaard and dead languages, and chill with my cats.
