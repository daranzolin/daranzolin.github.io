<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I studied English literature and religious studies, finishing my M.T.S from Emory University in 2013. After school I soon learned that writing code was more fun than writing papers.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
For data analysis and visualization, I use SQL, R, Python, D3.js, Git, and a little HTML/CSS. Software developed and maintained on GitHub. Other tools and applications: ESRI ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro, Observable, IBM Cognos Analytics.

I love hoop, golf, pickleball, books, games, code, dead languages, and chilling with my cats.
